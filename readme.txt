Honestly I made this for my dad

:About:

This nifty little thing put in hosts acceptions for you. When you put a url in the hostfile with an IP, it'll redirect to the ip instead of the site you typed in.
This program uses Googles IP, so when you visit a page you added in, you'll just go to Google instead.

:How To Use:

> Host File
The program will automaticly look for your hosts file and input it in this box. The browse is there incase you have your hosts file on another drive, partition, ect.

> Enter URL
This is obviously where you put the url. DO NOT PUT WWW IN FRONT OF THE URL! The program does that for you automaticly. 
If you process the URL and it shows that the url can be added in, it will let you click the Add button
